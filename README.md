# random-emoji-generator

The goal of this project is to create a random emoji generator with a "click" button that generates a random emoji and displays its name tag.
For example, the "cook" emoji is represented by a person holding a pen.
We will use JavaScript to retrieve data from an API and CSS to style the website. To get the necessary API keys, we will apply to the Emoji API website.
